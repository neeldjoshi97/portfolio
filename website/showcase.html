        <h2><i>Feature Matching in Stereo Images using Quasi Dense Feature Propagation Algorithm</i></h2>
        <p>This was implemented as the final project for the class 'Computer Vision for Engineers'. We worked as a team of 4 classmates.
           We implemented the entire process in parts, each member being responsible for one. The final Python script integrates the individual
            parts of the process such that the input of multiple 2D images is processed to output 3D point co-ordinates in Polygon File
            Format which can be imported into any 3D rendering software.<br><br>In case of many images of an object, it becomes difficult to find
            perfect (seed/sparse) keypoints (e.g. SIFT, SURF) which are present in all/most of the images at once. My part was concerned
            about implementing Quasi Dense Matching which uses certain conditions to find out neighbouring points of seed keypoints
            which can be used for triangulation (estimating correct 3D co-ordinates).<br><br>Using the standard Baby image, if one finds the SIFT
            feature matches in the left and the right image (stereo pair) and locate arbitrarily 2 of them like shown (bright red spots):</p>
        <figure>
          <img alt="One SIFT Feature" src="Images/baby_left.png "/><img alt="One SIFT Feature" src="Images/baby_right.png "/>
          <figcaption>Fig. 1: Baby images (stereo pair) with 2 matched feature points</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now after implementing the feature search algorithm, these are all the possible matches one gets with ZNCC threshold of 0.99999:</p>
        <figure>
          <img alt="One SIFT Feature" src="Images/baby_left_matched.png "/><img alt="One SIFT Feature" src="Images/baby_right_matched.png "/>
          <figcaption>Fig. 2: Baby images (same as above) with thousands of matched feature points</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Note:<br>1. Both the regions have similar shapes
          <br>2. It is evident that each feature point in the left image is mapped to a nearby point in the right image
          <br>3. The red patch (points matched) has a characteristic shape: e.g. 1) notice the holes left at some places where the
          points are not invariant, those are not matched; 2) notice that the red patch keeps its shape according to the lines in
          the map behind the baby (possible reason being that corner points in the map tend to be invariant points)
          Thus it can be seen that the algorithm (although na√Øve) does its job of matching thousands of key points which will be
          used for triangulation at the end (depth estimation).</p>

        <h2><i>Controller Programming for Autonomous Vehicles Simulation</i></h2>
        <p>As a 5 parts project for 'Modern Control - Theory and Design', the aim was to implement theory acquired in class in actual Python programs.
          While working on vehicle dynamics in simulations, I learned to tune basic PID controller, using both the gains method and pole placement;
          discrete-time infinite horizon LQR controller alongwith A* path planning to maneuver around obstacles and Extended Kalman Filter
          Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (EKF SLAM) to filter observation noise.
          <br><br><i><b>When competed against a class of ~65, my programmed car finished in top 8.</b></i>
          <br><br>For the closing part, I designed a Model Reference Adaptive Controller to study the effect of sudden failure in the thrust of a quadrotor mid-air.</p>
